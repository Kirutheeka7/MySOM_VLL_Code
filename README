READ THIS FILE completely before doing anything.

The minimal number of files in this folder are

Z_ll.root
ana.cpp
delZAna.h
delZAna.C
LinkDef.h
COMPILEIT
and this README

Z_ll.root is an input ntuple. It contains simulation
events (1000 events, to be precise).

As the name suggests it is simulation of a specific process,
the DY process. Eventually you will replace it with your
own file.

The main code (which does analysis and fills histograms) is
in the delZAna class. This class is declared and described in
delZAna.h and delZAna.C

ana.cpp is a driver script.

After all editing is done, we compile it all into a program
called ana by running two commands. These are given in
COMPILEIT. So edit the code (delZAna), then at the command prompt, type

>source COMPILEIT
(This will produce more files, as well as a program called ana)
Run the program ana as follows

>./ana 1
(That is 'dot slash ana numeral-one')

This will produce output files hst_Zee.root and sum_Zee.root


Now at runtime, the code needs to know where to find libDelphes.so
This is done by adding the folder to LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows
>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/sdube/Sourabh/Work/MCGeneration/delphes_git

I just added this line to my .bashrc file (you should change the last part
to wherever you have installed Delphes)

This has to be changed in the COMPILEIT file too.. the location
of your delphes_git folder has to be replaced in three places
in the COMPILEIT file.
